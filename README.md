# Responsive Layout Challenges
## 1)  Day 1 Challenge:
*   Limit the total width of the .intro-content to about half of it's parent
*   Stop the text from overflowing out the bottom at small screen widths
## 2) Day 2 Challenge:  
* em -> The em unit is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent. If used for other properties like margin, padding, width, etc.
* for Ex. parent font-size 2em and child font size is 2em then 2em font size of child becomes 2*2 = 4em.
* rem -> The rem unit is relative to the font-size of the root element.
* If used for font-size, 1rem is equal to the font-size of the root element.
* so for font-size use rem and for padding and marging use em.
